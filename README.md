January 25, 2024 - I am now beginning the linked list project as a part of The Odin Project's Javascript track. I will build a linked list data structure and several functions to use with the linked list for things like adding and removing nodes.

February 24, 2024 - I have finished the linked list project. Started out difficult until I figured out how to loop through the linked list, then it was pretty smooth. The insertAt() function gave me some trouble until I pseudocoded it out and looked at what I was trying to do in plain language, and with a drawn diagram. I learned in this process that visualizing the data structure, even just in the console log, is immensely helpful.
